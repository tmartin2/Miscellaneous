#### Desires
> I need to still adequately differentiate the purpose of Desires, ImagineX, What if?, and Questions.

- Look for a way to track your changing states of mind: calmness + improved ability to speak,
stuttery + uncoordinated, stressed + in a state of flow, manic + exceptional linguistic ability.
- Look for a way to track and improve the quality and duration of your sleep
- Look into ways to visualize brain waves.
- Research dietary effects on brain wave fluctuations and method of brain wave manipulation.
- A non-pharmaceutical mechanism to increase endogenous attention and concentration without downside.

#### ImagineX
> I need to still adequately differentiate the purpose of Desires, ImagineX, What if?, and Questions.

- Imagine reciting poems you've memorized during intercourse; I think this would be awesome.
- Imagine explaining a phone to a 17th century intellectual.
- Imagine (visualize) a lamp post wrapping around itself.
- Imagine a life without having to deficate or urinate (maybe through bacteria that reabsorb waste into your body).
- Imagine if human genitals were where the bellybutton is.

#### What if?
> I need to still adequately differentiate the purpose of Desires, ImagineX, What if?, and Questions.

- What if people's abilities to speak or form sentences mentally were limited, to where they could only speak 1,000 words each day before having to regain the capacity to form new words.
- What if societies of Neaderthals and Sapiens existed concurrently?
- What if people could scroll through their memories like scrolling through an album of photos on their phone?
- What if people could simply undergo some biological operation (maybe via nanorobotics or stem cells) that commanded the body's hormones to change
the proportionality of any appendage, organ, or body part?
- What if something could be downloaded to the brain, like a DMT experience of something learning program from the movie _The Matrix_?
- What if I just took a full year to study something? Like, no Internet except to aid in studying. No other books besides those related? No other serious pursuit? No other worries?

#### Unfiltered Insights
- Will you care about this in the long run?
- What is the hardest you've ever worked on something?
- Look people in the eyes.
- Stand up and sit up straight.
- Is there any easier way to do this?
- Think before you speak and avoid saying dumb things.
- Remind yourself everyday of what you want to achieve.
- You can't learn everything.
- What should guide what you choose to study? Impact, future opportunities, enjoyment?
- Potentially avoid remaking what's already made.
- Actually think about what you are copying, when you need to.
- Focusing on something right before bed seems to help in doing that thing the following morning.
- Avoiding idleness and low diversity in thought environments.
- Avoid reacting quickly as much as possible.
- Not exercising produces gradually degradations in thinking and motivation.
- Keep close to smart, honest, and ambitious people.
- There seems to be a trend towards things getting more complex. Futuristic inventions and
solutions will probably involved many things operating and integrated smoothly. They will
probably be very complex and if you are to aid in this development, it would help to have
domain knowledge in more than a single discipline.
- Motos: Robust science, rigorous skepticism

#### Unbranched and Biased Questions / Things Worth Studying
> These questions have not themselves been subjected to scrutiny, scrutiny 
> that would reduce their latent bias and would help to branch the question
> into multiple other questions which are more specific. For example, asking
> How should human society handle drugs? assumes drugs needs to be handled, uses
> the word "handle" which has a negative connotation and indicates that the drugs in
> question are probably those that are abused, and ignores that there are
> many different types of human societies.

- Imagine a flashy spaceship lands in your backyard. The door opens and you are invited to investigate

can make. <br> This is biology

### Reflections
> Personal 

- Why do things begin to go awry? (sleep schedule gets fucked, no motivation to work, a task becomes unapproachable, you are extremely fatigued)
- Can you actually adhere to the schedules you desire to adhere to? (Are they unattainable and you feel bad for no reason?)
- Why can't you effectively work on something for a long period of time (Your interests evaporate somewhat quickly and your coursework usually begins to bore you, even though you usually lose understanding of what is going on before this occurs).
- How can you fix your brain constantly seeming to lag behind in things?
- Do you think it'd benefit you to be silent more often and to hang out with people less often?
- Why can't you ask people out?

## W1: Completion of eight mathematics problems

1. (1.2) Prove that if $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on a set $S$, then the corresponding family
$\mathcal{P}_{\sim}$ defined earlier is indeed a partition of $S$: that is, its elements are non-empty,
disjoint, and their union is $S$\
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ans. (attempt 1) We must show that the set $\{[a]_{\sim} | a \in S\}$ forms a partition of $S$. By
definition, a partition of a set is a family of disjoint nonempty subsets of the set whose union is the set. So,
we must show that $\bigcup_{X \in \{[a]_{\sim} | a \in S\}} X = S$ and that $(a \in S)(b \in S)[a]_{\sim} \neq [b]_{\sim}
\Longrightarrow [a]_{\sim} \cap [b]_{\sim} = \emptyset$.\

2. (1.3) Given a partition $\mathcal{P}$ on a set $S$, show how to define a relation $\sim$
on $S$ such that $\mathcal{P}$ is the corresponding partition.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ans. (attempt 1)\

3. (1.4) How many different equivalence relations may be defined on the set $\{1,2,3\}$?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ans. (attempt 1) We can find the number of equivalence relations by inspecting
the relations that can be formed from the Cartesian product $\{1,2,3\} \times \{1,2,3\} =
\{(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\}$. By definition of an equivalence
relation, the

4. (1.5) Give an example of an equivalence relation that is reflexive and symmetric but not
transitive. What happens if you try to use this relation to define a partition on a set?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ans. (attempt 1)\

5. (1.6) Define a relation $\sim$ on the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers by set $a \sim b \iff b - a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Prove that this is an equivalence relation and find a 'compelling' description for $\mathbb{R} / \sim$.\

## Time Sensitive Wagers

None for the time being.

## Bets

I did not eat any RxBars today (3/7)

## Lost Wagers = {W1}

I lost the math wager again today. I now have to do 5 more 2 minutes planks as a consequence.

```Python
import random

p = ['Ben', 'Roy', 'J_Striz', 'J_Sav']
random.shuffle(p)
print(p[0])
```

Joseph Savage won $4. I need to mail this you, Joseph. I sent the other letter today. So expect another
one to arrive a day or so later.
